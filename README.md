# Challenge - Library System


This project was developed as part of a challenge in the Java course, taught by [Rocketset](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lead&utm_term=perpetuo&utm_content=institucional-lead-home-texto-lead-brandkws-none-none-institucional-none-none-br-google&utm_term=rocketseat&utm_campaign=PROGRAMAS-ALL-BRANDKWS-SEM&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&hsa_acc=8545075154&hsa_cam=16048648686&hsa_grp=135825188594&hsa_ad=579096962131&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-679159515078&hsa_kw=rocketseat&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjr3l1u7AiAMVlF5IAB1RLxWXEAAYASAAEgJRJ_D_BwE), in the Java Fundamentals module.


The goal is to apply fundamental Java concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, looping structures, and date manipulation.

### Book Management
- List all available books: displays only books that are available for loan.
- Borrow a book: allows a user to select an available book and register the loan.

### After starting
The application will ask if you want to view the available books. Once you select a book, you can proceed with the loan, which will be recorded, and the book will be marked as unavailable.
